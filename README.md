###Simple example of how to create expandable table view cells


In this example, I show one of the possible ways to create expandable table view cells.
What seems to be such an easy task, and present in many applications and customer requirements nowadays, is usually taking too much effort for developers to code, so I thought of a simple way to solve this problem.

I needed to create a simple expandable table view cell and found out that all the libraries that were dealing with this problem, were either not functional or didn't work on latest environment. 

Note that this source code is not a "ready-to-go drag-and-drop" framework. It just shows you _one possible way_ of creating expandable cells.

##Features

- Expandable Table View Cells
- Dynamic table view cell height, which depends on the text view content height
- Auto-resize table view cell upon user interaction on text view content
- Keeps cursor always on focus
